# Yohns AI Chatbot
If you do not have access to [Github's Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) then you will need to get an API key from OpenAI, or maybe AzureAI to use this.

Update the `.env.example` file with your [Github Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

This is just for testing purposes, in a personal enviroment, to see how this whole thing works. Chats are not saved. The AI Chat bot does not have any memory of messages, and only knows the message you sent, 1 at a time. Very basic for now but it is working.
